(Verse)
Combatants of space squad nine,
That's us, we burst of joy.
Dozens of the eggheads are
Just fine, under control.

Must preserve their sanity
And keep them off the craze.
All we need is them to get through
That thing that's dark as space.

(Chorus)
With scientific passion
We dive [...or die]

We're back, still standing, could've been worse,
Almost have been dissolved.
Thanks to noodle-brainiac
That kept us off the hole.

Now preparing for jump,
Passing all procedures well.
Let's face our doom and fate.
They said this must be the gate.

(Chorus)
Blending in a swirly fasion
We dive [...or die]

Escape to shuttle      -  Fight		
###
Write song lyrics in death metal style about colonists requiring to leave the Earth urgently on a space shuttle due to ongoing catastrophe. Some strong language may be used. Specific space flight details are required too. Idea is that colonists try to find the star ship and then successfully get on that and ready start their journey. Song is in 5/8. It has two verses, two bridges and no choruses. First verse is upbeat, then bridge is downbeat. Second verse is upbeat, then bridge is downbeat.
```ChatGPT version:

(Verse 1 - upbeat)
In a world ablaze, chaos reigns supreme,
Colonists seeking refuge, a desperate dream,
Amidst the devastation, they rise above,
Boarding the shuttle, bound for the stars they love.

(Bridge 1 - downbeat)
The Earth crumbles, a wasteland of despair,
But hope ignites within, a flame they share,
Through the wreckage and ruins, they fight,
To find the star ship, their beacon of light.

(Verse 2 - upbeat)
Engines roaring, the shuttle takes flight,
Defying gravity, soaring through the night,
In the face of destruction, they stand tall,
Leaving behind the ashes, answering the call.

(Bridge 2 - downbeat)
A mournful cry echoes, for what's been lost,
But they push forward, no matter the cost,
In the void of space, their destiny awaits,
A new home to conquer, beyond the gates.

(Bridge 1 - downbeat)
The Earth crumbles, a wasteland of despair,
But hope ignites within, a flame they share,
Through the wreckage and ruins, they fight,
To find the star ship, their beacon of light.

(Verse 2 - upbeat)
With every heartbeat, they venture on,
Through cosmic storms, their courage won't be gone,
Navigating the unknown, they strive,
To ensure humanity's survival, they'll thrive.

(Bridge 2 - downbeat)
A mournful cry echoes, for what's been lost,
But they push forward, no matter the cost,
In the void of space, their destiny awaits,
A new home to conquer, beyond the gates.

(Outro)
In the depths of space, their journey unfolds,
Colonists united, their spirits bold,
Leaving behind the chaos, they ascend,
To a future unknown, where their hopes won't end.

Hymn to colonists      -  Andromeda

							Verse1:
								Watching stars from the early days
								Praising gods in profound ways
								[wa-a-ys wa-a-ys ways]
								
								True glory consists in doing what deserves to be written;
								In writing what deserves to be read [Pilny the Elder]
								
								
								
								For everything there is a season and a time
								For every purpose under heaven [Ecclesiastes]
								I bring about the rule of rightiousness in the land
								So that strong shouldn't harm the weak [Hammurabi's code]								
								
								Some books're to be tasted
								Others to be swallowed,
								And some to be few chewed and digested [Sir Francis Bacon]
								
								That I do without being commanded what 
								Others do only from the fear of law [Ptolemeus]


								Know well that leads you forward
								And what holds you back [The Buddha]


							Sub:
								From each  according  to their abilities
								  To each  according  to their needs
							Chorus:
								Praise new land
								We're here to build our settlement
								Forming a fair society
